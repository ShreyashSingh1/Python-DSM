API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows 
different software(Eg. Bank and Gpay) applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define the methods 
and data formats that applications can use to request or exchange information. They enable developers 
to access the functionality of an application or service without having to understand or modify 
the underlying code.

An API is like a set of rules that lets different software applications talk to each other. It's a way for 
them to share information and work together without needing to understand each other's inner workings.

Think of it like ordering food at a restaurant. You don't need to know how the kitchen works or what ingredients 
they have. You just need to know how to communicate your order to the waiter using the menu. The menu acts as 
the API, providing a standardized way for you to request the food you want.

Similarly, an API provides a menu of options for different software applications. It defines the ways they can 
ask for information or perform actions. This makes it easier for developers to use existing software features in 
their own applications without needing to start from scratch.

APIs can be used for various purposes, such as retrieving data from a remote server, sending data to a 
third-party service, performing actions or operations on a system, or even controlling hardware devices. 
They are commonly used in web development, mobile app development, cloud computing, and many other areas 
of software development.
